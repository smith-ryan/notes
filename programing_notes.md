HERE ARE SOME GENERAL PROGRAMMING/SCRIPTING NOTES THAT HELP MAKE LIFE A LITTLE EASIER

Setting up a python venv

-Build your VENV in your project folder along with your project files; I will save a config file and the actual project files as well (.ipynb or /py)
-Example:
    -C:\\Users\smithr11\pyproj\weather>C:\Users\smithr11\pyver\py3107\python -m venv venv-weather
-If you move a VENV from the location it was originally built, this will most likely break it
-Start adding packages/libraries using pip install
    -This keeps the packages/libraries as part of this venv
